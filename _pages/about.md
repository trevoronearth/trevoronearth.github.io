Hey all! My name is Trevor and I am currently studying my Masters of Applied Science at SFU in Sustainable Energy Engineering. My research is currently on PEM fuel cell and water electrolyzer electrochemical modelling for diagnostic methods, working with the FCRel group, but my interests are wide-ranging! Mostly, in general, I am interested in physics, modelling, and sustainability, and am still curious and motivated to explore other related fields!

How did I get here?
======
Growing up, I was always curious about why the world behaved in the way it did. Such as when we'd play wall ball in elementary school, how would the ball come back in the way it did? Or whenever I was bored in the car, I'd think about why can't all the cars speed up at the same time in traffic (I still think about this), and are cars actually turning the world around like a treadmill (This was mostly wrong)? Overall, I loved to think about questions like this, and my Dad always loved to answer! I grew up really enjoying math and puzzles, which may have been an early indicator of me becoming an engineer.
Today, it feels very easy to fall out of the love for curiosity, by making habituous judgements, and believing we already understand everything that is happening. I want to continue fostering my child-like innate love for curiosity, and always be open to new ideas, opportunities, and people!

Anyway, fast-forwarding to high school, I started getting really interested in computers and coding! Me and my dad made my first PC together in Sophmore year while I was taking a computer technican course. From here, I wanted to become an ethical hacker. I honestly wasn't too interested in school, besides a few classes, but I definetly had big dreams! I applied to Colorado School of Mines, not really expecting to get in, but to my surprise, I was accepted after just two months from submitting the application! I was astonished and happy that I now had a plan. For this last year of high school, I just focused on maintaining decent grades and finishing up everything. However, I never really felt a consistent motivation or drive towards the passions and dreams I strived for. It always felt like I just going along and getting by. Although I wanted to become an ethical hacker, at least looking back on it, it wasn't for a noble goal or for the right reasons. At the time, I didn't notice this, and was continuing towards that path. That was until I took my first ever course on Physics in my senior year of high school. 

As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed math and felt that I was good at it (although I believe my enjoyment of it is really what made me good at it). When I start my physics class, I wasn't really expecting anything from it. Just needed to pass. To my surprise, all of the things I used to think about as a kid, like how balls bounce, and how gravity works, was being taught in this class, as well as how to calculate it using math! I couldn't believe it! Along with that, the teacher was one of the most passionate, energetic, and engaging teachers I have ever had. This was truly one of the first times I ever looked forward to doing my homework again since my math homeowrk from elementary school.

Hobbies
======
Outside of school, I love to hike, climb, cook, be outside, slackline, read, meditate, and trying new things!
Although, my main joys come from relaxing, choosing kindness, and being around the people I love.
