* **Industrial/Research**
  * Research Assistant at Simon Fraser University (FCREL/Greenlight Innovations), September 2024 - Current
    * Conducting literature review on in-situ electrochemical testing techniques to find paths of improvement and scalability for PEM fuel cell and water electrolyzer end-of-line testing.
    * Manufacturing cells from scratch to be used for testing.
    * Using Python to test different fitting methods for accuracy improvement.
    * Learning how to manage time efficiently, design unique and effective experiments, and embrace scientific uncertainty.

  * Technology Integration Intern at Solid Power, May 2024 - August 2024                                                                  
    * Investigated the advancement of new generation solid state electrolytes by building test cells, then analyzing cycle life and rate capability, to better understand the effect of changes in electrolyte          formulation on cell performance.
    * Utilized characterization techniques such as EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy), Nanoindentation, and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope).
    * Programmed Python scripts using Pandas and Matplotlib to automate data collection and analysis for more efficient and effective data representation.
    * Performed troubleshooting for failing cells by using first principles thinking and the scientific method.
 
  * Undergraduate Researcher at Colorado School of Mines, January 2024 - May 2024
    * Studied basics of electrochemistry and rechargeable battery technology.
    * Used Python library called Pymatgen to create and manipulate molecular structures.
    * Queried data from Materials Project database to find potential molecular structures to be used as a cathode.
    * Trained on XRD experimentation to compare theoretical and experimental data.
