Hey all! My name is Trevor and I am currently studying my Masters of Applied Science at SFU in Sustainable Energy Engineering. My research is currently on PEM fuel cell and water electrolyzer electrochemical modelling for diagnostic methods, working with the FCRel group, but my interests are wide-ranging! Mostly, in general, I am interested in physics, modelling, and sustainability, and am still curious and motivated to explore other related fields!


How did I get here?
