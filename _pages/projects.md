Testing the Radiation Shielding Capabilities of BP-1 Regolith for the Use on Lunar Missions
======
Through the Colorado Space Grant Consortium DEMOSAT Program, a team of 4 other students and I designed an experiment to test the effectiveness of BP-1 regolith as a radiation shield for the potential use on lunar missions. BP-1 regolith has similar properties to dust on the moon and Mars, so understanding its radiation protective properties are highly sought after. The experiment was designed in a box with required specifications on weight, size, and materials, which was then strapped to a weather balloon and sent to the stratosphere. Measurements were collected over altitude and then the data was retrieved and analyzed.
